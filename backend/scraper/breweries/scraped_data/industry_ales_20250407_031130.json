        "description": "This quite uncommon beer style is rarely seen in brewpubs, likely because it's hard to pinpoint what exactly this style of beer is, with no approved beer judging standards, and an almost folklore history to it's background. The biere de mars is a cousin of the biere de garde, but usually lighter, fresher and more related to the spring release it is named after. Our Bloom & Doom is brewed with barley, wheat and rye, and hopped with French Alsatian hops, and fermented with a German Ale yeast. Look for notes of baked bread, cherry blossom and red plum.",

A pitch black body topped by a persistent tan head. The aroma is a subtle mix of dark chocolate, black currant and underneath it all, tangy hibiscus. The flavor brings it all together, with a light roastiness that is complimented by mid-pallate flavors of mulberry and cacao. The hibiscus and lime flavors steer the overall taste in a distinctly more tangy direction, and brings a balancing lightness to the dark.",

The beer is fruity, but dry, and carries flavors of citron (like a mix of lemon, lime and yuzu), passion fruit, and geraniol (floral and tropical). Behind the hop veil is a small but supporting malt flavor that could best be described as \u2018doughy\u2019 or \u2018cracker-like\u2019.",

This dark ale is packed with flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg and Caribbean rum barrel. The malt base has oatmeal and roasted barley to create a soft-bodied, smooth finish.
