# ChicagoBeerFinder
Web app built and supported by Claude to help me catalog Chicago beers

Basic tenents: I have used Claude AI to give me a boost in this overall project and app setup.
Claude walked me through how to stand up a basic GitHub CodeSpaces environment, gave me step-by-step instructions and code
to include within this repository. I created the backend and frontend files, pasted the code, and voila. 
Requirement.txt file, Backend Python scraper, backend Python Flask API, frontend React javascript App, frontend React JSON package.
